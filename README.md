## US 2020 Elections Prediction
Predicting US 2020 Elections results applying Sentiment Analysis on a sample of US tweets and then computing the most likely vote of each of the users to make the final prediction.

## Text Analytics for Customer Care
Creating dashboard that the Customer Service Department can consume with the objective of being able to detect the unsatisfied customers, the main topics why they are unsatisfied, see the customer's history, and many other graphs that help them to improve the Customer Service.

To create the dashboard, the text of the reviews must preprocessed in order to standardize the text, eliminate emojis and stopwords. Then using an LSTM model we perform Sentiment analysis using as input the standardized reviews text and we use these results to create the dashboard.
