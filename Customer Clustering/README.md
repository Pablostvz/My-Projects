# Customer Clustering
Contains a jupyter notebook where hierarchical clustering is applied to an e-commerce dataset, in order to obtain insights and use them to make decisions in hypotetical realistic situations. 

The clustering results are then exported to an excel file (*output.xlsx*) which is used to create a Tableau Dashboard.
